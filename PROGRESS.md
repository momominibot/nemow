## Known Issues
- Some internal wiki article links (#) are placeholders
- Existing pages (home.html, cycle-home.html, etc.) still have the old 5-tab navigation; only learn.html and settings.html were updated with new nav
- The persona CSS on new pages references the `--ovaria-*` variables but existing pages in the old nav (home.html, etc.) still use the original theme.css `--cocoa`, `--mauve` variables
- Lottie animations on learn.html reference local asset files that may not exist

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel preview
2. Test all pages on mobile viewport
3. Update remaining pages' navigation to the new 5-tab layout
4. Add actual article content for placeholder links
