# BRIEF — Nemow v2 · TCM-Integrated Ovarian Health Platform

## Goal
Evolve Nemow from a general women's health app into a TCM-integrated ovarian health standalone app. Add acupoint/myofascial relief guidance, evidence-based Chinese + Western food tracking, and a life-stage persona system where each profile (teens, TTC, post-pregnancy, pre/post-menopause) gets its own themed interface. Deploy to Vercel production.

## Core Vision
Nemow is the co-pilot app for Nemow surfaces evidence-based science through a beautiful, persona-adaptive interface. TCM wellness is a first-class feature: acupoints, myofascial relief, and food as medicine — all evidence-based, blending Eastern and Western knowledge.

## Constraints
- Must preserve existing Nemow watercolor design system as the base
- Each life-stage persona gets a DISTINCT theme (palette, typography, illustrations)
- TCM content must be evidence-based — cite sources
- Food knowledge must include BOTH Chinese medicine principles AND Western nutritional science
- All content lives in the Knowledge Hub with persona-filtered views
- Mobile-first (390px viewport)
- Do NOT break existing pages or navigation
- Co-branded: "Nemow"
